// turbo-all

This workflow automatically stages all changes, generates a descriptive commit message, and commits them in one go.

### Steps:

1. **Stage All Changes**: Automatically stage all modified and new files.

	`git add .`

2. **Analyze Changes**: Get the diff of staged changes to understand the context.
	`git diff --cached`

3. **Generate & Commit**: Generate a professional message following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) and execute the commit.
	`git commit -m "<ai_generated_message>"`

4. **Push**: Optionally push the changes.
	`git push`
